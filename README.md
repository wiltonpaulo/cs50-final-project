# Invoicing System Project

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/c/wiltonpaulo

#### Description:

This project was created thinking about solving a repetitive and manual activity that happens to freelancers or companies that need to generate several invoices for services performed for their clients.

Through a menu on the command line, customer information, type of service, date and other data for generating the invoice are created.

With this project I should acquire knowledge of object orientation, sqllite database with sqlalchemy, creation of tests and also improve my knowledge in python programming.

What to expect about this project: - Good outcome: -
